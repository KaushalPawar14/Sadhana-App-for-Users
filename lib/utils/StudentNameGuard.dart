// Why `sadhana-reports`/`hostel-sadhana`/`scorecard`/`competition`/
// `notification` being name-keyed makes this load-bearing
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The product owner's own decision (this task's context): keep those five
// collections keyed by student NAME rather than migrate to uid-keying, and
// instead guarantee names are unique and stable. If two students ever end
// up with the same normalized name, every one of those five collections
// silently collides — one student's sadhana reports, scores and
// notifications become indistinguishable from (or overwrite) the other's.
// This file is the entire guarantee that failure mode never happens.

// Storage vs. comparison — Part 2 item 2

// normalizeStudentName() is applied to what gets STORED in `users.name` —
// trimmed, internal whitespace collapsed to one space — so the stored
// name and the key later used to look up `sadhana-reports/{name}` etc. can
// never diverge (both are always this same normalized string). Original
// capitalization is preserved in storage — a real name's casing is not
// noise to discard, and every existing name-keyed collection already
// expects real casing. Casing is folded ONLY inside isStudentNameTaken()'s
// own comparison, never applied to what's written.
